- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Deepshikha Kumari.
- ðŸ‘€ I have keen interest in high voltage and deep learning - two extremely discrete but equally cardinal domains and 
     I enjoy working towards the amalgamation of both to find smart solutions. Personally, GitHub has been the greatest source of information and inspiration and 
     I am here to take baby steps towards contributing to this ingenious society.
- ðŸŒ± I am an incoming masters student at ETH Zurich in the major electrical engineering and information technology.
- ðŸ“« Please reach me out at deepshikha.412192@gmail.com for collaboration.
